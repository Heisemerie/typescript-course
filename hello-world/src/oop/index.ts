//OOP
//It is a programming paradigm. JS supports functional and OOP techniques
//In OOP objects are the building blocks of the application
//An object is a unit that contains Data (state) and Operations (behavior)
//For example you can have a person object with data 'name' and 'email' and operations 'talk()' and 'dance()'
//They are referred to as properties and methods respectfully
